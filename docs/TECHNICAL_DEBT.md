# Dottie AI Assistant - Technical Debt Register

This document tracks technical debt items in the Dottie AI Assistant project that have been acknowledged and scheduled for future resolution. Each item includes a description, impact, and planned resolution timeline.

## Current Technical Debt Items

### 1. Express-Session Removal

**Description:**  
The application currently uses express-session for some authentication flows, but the CTO has directed a complete migration to Firebase-only authentication.

**Impact:**  
- Maintains two parallel authentication mechanisms
- Increases code complexity
- May cause inconsistent session handling

**Resolution Plan:**  
- Replace all express-session usage with Firebase ID tokens
- Use Firebase ID token in Authorization Bearer header for all backend requests
- Store Google OAuth refresh tokens in Firestore, associated with Firebase User ID

**Timeline:** Post-initial launch (Q2 2025)

**Assigned To:** Backend Team

**Status:** Planned

### 2. Type Assertions (`as any`)

**Description:**  
Several areas in the codebase use TypeScript's `as any` type assertion, which bypasses type checking and reduces type safety.

**Impact:**  
- Reduces TypeScript's ability to catch type errors
- Makes refactoring more difficult
- Decreases code maintainability

**Resolution Plan:**  
- Identify all instances of `as any` usage
- Replace with proper TypeScript interfaces and type guards
- Add appropriate error handling for edge cases

**Timeline:** Ongoing, prioritize critical paths (Q2-Q3 2025)

**Assigned To:** Full-stack Team

**Status:** In Progress

### 3. Test Coverage Gaps

**Description:**  
While core components have good test coverage, some areas of the application lack comprehensive tests, particularly integration tests for Google service interactions.

**Impact:**  
- Increases risk of undetected bugs
- Makes refactoring more risky
- Slows down development velocity

**Resolution Plan:**  
- Identify critical paths with insufficient test coverage
- Implement integration tests for all Google service interactions
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user journeys

**Timeline:** Q2 2025

**Assigned To:** QA Team

**Status:** Planned

### 4. Frontend Component Structure

**Description:**  
Some frontend components have grown too large and handle multiple responsibilities, violating the single responsibility principle.

**Impact:**  
- Reduces code reusability
- Makes testing more difficult
- Increases cognitive load for developers

**Resolution Plan:**  
- Refactor large components into smaller, focused components
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Implement consistent component patterns

**Timeline:** Q3 2025

**Assigned To:** Frontend Team

**Status:** Planned

---

### 5. Error Handling Standardization

**Description:**  
While a centralized error handling system has been implemented, some parts of the application still use custom error handling approaches.

**Impact:**  
- Inconsistent error messages for users
- Incomplete error logging
- Harder to diagnose issues

**Resolution Plan:**  
- Ensure all errors flow through the centralized error handling middleware
- Standardize error response formats across all endpoints
- Improve correlation ID tracking

**Timeline:** Q2 2025

**Assigned To:** Backend Team

**Status:** In Progress

---

### 6. API Documentation

**Description:**  
The API lacks comprehensive documentation, making it difficult for frontend developers to understand available endpoints and requirements.

**Impact:**  
- Slows down frontend development
- Increases communication overhead
- May lead to incorrect API usage

**Resolution Plan:**  
- Implement OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Add JSDoc comments to all API controllers
- Create a developer portal for API documentation

**Timeline:** Q2 2025

**Assigned To:** Backend Team

**Status:** Planned

---

### 7. Environment Configuration Management

**Description:**  
Environment variables are managed inconsistently across environments, with some hardcoded values and duplicated configuration.

**Impact:**  
- Makes environment transitions more error-prone
- Increases deployment complexity
- May expose sensitive information

**Resolution Plan:**  
- Standardize environment variable naming and usage
- Implement a centralized configuration management system
- Use Secret Manager consistently for all sensitive values

**Timeline:** Q2 2025

**Assigned To:** DevOps Team

**Status:** Planned

---

### 8. Performance Optimization

**Description:**  
Initial implementation focuses on functionality rather than performance, with potential bottlenecks in API calls and rendering.

**Impact:**  
- May cause slow response times under load
- Suboptimal user experience
- Higher cloud resource usage

**Resolution Plan:**  
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries
- Add performance monitoring and profiling

**Timeline:** Q3 2025

**Assigned To:** Full-stack Team

**Status:** Planned

## Technical Debt Management Process

### Identification

Technical debt items can be identified through:
- Code reviews
- Static analysis tools
- Performance testing
- Developer feedback

### Documentation

All technical debt items should be:
- Added to this register
- Linked to GitHub issues
- Discussed in team meetings

### Prioritization

Technical debt items are prioritized based on:
- Impact on user experience
- Development velocity impact
- Security implications
- Alignment with business goals

### Resolution

When addressing technical debt:
- Create a specific branch for the work
- Include comprehensive tests
- Document the changes
- Update this register

## Conclusion

This technical debt register will be reviewed and updated regularly as part of the development process. The goal is to maintain a balance between delivering new features and addressing technical debt to ensure the long-term health of the codebase.
