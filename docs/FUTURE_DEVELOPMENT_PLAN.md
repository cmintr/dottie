# Dottie AI Assistant - Future Development Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines potential future development directions, features, and enhancements for the Dottie AI Assistant. It serves as a strategic planning tool for discussion and prioritization by the CTO, Architecture team, Product Management, and Development teams following the successful integration of the initial security architecture overhaul.

The goal is to evolve Dottie from a functional assistant into a more powerful, integrated, and intelligent tool that provides significant value and differentiation.

## Potential Development Areas & Features

### 1. Core AI & Capabilities Enhancements

*   **Advanced NLU & Context:**
    *   Improve understanding of complex, multi-part requests.
    *   Enhance long-term context retention across conversations.
    *   Develop better disambiguation when user requests are unclear.
*   **Proactive Assistance:**
    *   Identify user needs based on calendar events, email content, or observed work patterns (e.g., "You have a meeting with X soon, would you like me to summarize recent emails?").
    *   Suggest relevant actions or information without explicit requests.
*   **Personalization:**
    *   Learn user preferences for communication style, summarization depth, frequently used tools/contacts.
    *   Allow users to explicitly teach Dottie preferences or shortcuts.
*   **Multi-modal Interaction:**
    *   Explore voice command input and voice response output.
    *   Investigate the potential for understanding or generating content from images/screenshots.
*   **Improved Function Calling & Reasoning:**
    *   Enhance the ability to chain multiple tool calls effectively to fulfill complex tasks.
    *   Improve error handling and recovery when tool calls fail.
    *   Explore techniques for the LLM to better explain its reasoning process.

### 2. Integrations Ecosystem

*   **Broader SaaS Tool Support:**
    *   Integrate with popular CRM systems (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot).
    *   Add support for project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana, Trello).
    *   Connect with communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) for notifications or actions.
    *   Support for more document/knowledge base tools (e.g., Confluence, Notion).
*   **Custom Integration Framework:**
    *   Develop an SDK or defined API for third parties or internal teams to integrate their own tools and services with Dottie.
*   **Advanced Calendar/Scheduling:**
    *   More sophisticated meeting scheduling, including finding common free times across multiple complex calendars.
    *   Automated conflict resolution suggestions.
*   **Email Enhancements:**
    *   Drafting assistance based on context or templates.
    *   Automated email categorization or prioritization suggestions.

### 3. User Experience (UX) & Interface

*   **Revamped Frontend UI:**
    *   Modernize the user interface for better clarity and ease of use.
    *   Improve visualization of information retrieved (e.g., charts from spreadsheets, timelines from project plans).
    *   Implement a more robust notification system within the UI.
*   **Mobile Application:**
    *   Develop native iOS and Android applications for on-the-go access.
*   **Customizable Dashboards:**
    *   Allow users to create personalized dashboards showing key information or frequently used actions.

### 4. Enterprise Readiness

*   **Team & Collaboration Features:**
    *   Enable shared context or knowledge within teams.
    *   Allow task delegation or information sharing between users via Dottie.
*   **Advanced Admin Console:**
    *   Provide administrators with dashboards for usage analytics, cost tracking, and user management.
    *   Implement granular permission controls for features and data access.
    *   Tools for managing integrations and configurations centrally.
*   **Single Sign-On (SSO):**
    *   Integrate with standard enterprise SSO solutions (e.g., SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect).
*   **Compliance & Auditing:**
    *   Implement comprehensive audit logging for all actions performed by Dottie.
    *   Pursue relevant compliance certifications (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) based on target market needs.
    *   Introduce data governance features (e.g., data retention policies, regional data handling).
*   **On-Premise / VPC Deployment:**
    *   Investigate and potentially offer deployment options within a customer's private cloud or on-premise infrastructure for maximum data control.

### 5. Performance, Scalability & Cost Optimization

*   **Latency Reduction:**
    *   Optimize interactions with LLMs and external APIs.
    *   Implement intelligent caching strategies.
*   **Scalability Architecture:**
    *   Refine the backend architecture to handle a significantly larger number of concurrent users and requests efficiently.
    *   Optimize database interactions and session management at scale.
*   **Cost Management:**
    *   Fine-tune LLM usage (prompt engineering, model selection) to manage API costs.
    *   Optimize cloud resource utilization (e.g., serverless scaling parameters, database sizing).

## Next Steps

1.  **Review & Prioritization:** Discuss these potential areas with Product Management, Development Leads, and other stakeholders.
2.  **Feasibility Assessment:** Conduct technical feasibility studies for high-priority items.
3.  **Roadmap Development:** Integrate prioritized items into the official product roadmap.
4.  **Resource Allocation:** Plan resource needs based on the agreed-upon roadmap.

This document should be considered a living blueprint, updated regularly as the project evolves and market feedback is gathered.
