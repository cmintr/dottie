# Firebase Authentication Implementation

This document outlines the Firebase Authentication implementation in the Dottie AI Assistant application.

## Overview

Firebase Authentication is used to manage user authentication in the frontend. It provides secure authentication methods, including Google Sign-In, and integrates with the backend services through Firebase ID tokens.

## Architecture

The authentication flow follows these steps:

1. User signs in with Google using Firebase Authentication in the frontend
2. Firebase returns a user object and ID token
3. The frontend includes the ID token in API requests to the backend
4. The backend verifies the ID token using the Firebase Admin SDK
5. After verification, the backend can link the user's Google account for accessing Google services

## Frontend Implementation

### Key Components

- **Firebase Configuration** (`src/lib/firebase.ts`): Initializes Firebase with environment variables
- **Authentication Context** (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`): Provides global authentication state
- **SignInButton** (`src/components/SignInButton.tsx`): Handles Google authentication
- **SignOutButton** (`src/components/SignOutButton.tsx`): Handles user sign-out
- **GoogleAccountLink** (`src/components/GoogleAccountLink.tsx`): Links Google Workspace account
- **AuthStatusCheck** (`src/components/AuthStatusCheck.tsx`): Tests authenticated API calls

### Authentication Flow

1. The `AuthProvider` component initializes and listens for authentication state changes
2. When a user clicks the sign-in button, `signInWithPopup` is called with a Google provider
3. After successful authentication, the user state is updated in the context
4. The UI adapts to show the authenticated user's information
5. The user can then link their Google Workspace account for additional services

## Backend Integration

The frontend makes authenticated API calls to the backend by:

1. Retrieving the current user's ID token using `user.getIdToken()`
2. Including the token in the Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer ${idToken}`
3. The backend verifies this token using the Firebase Admin SDK

## Environment Configuration

The following environment variables are required:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
```

## Testing

Authentication tests are implemented using Vitest and React Testing Library:

- Unit tests for authentication components
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- Mock implementations for Firebase services

## Deployment Considerations

When deploying the application:

1. Set up Firebase project and enable Google authentication
2. Configure proper redirect domains in Firebase Console
3. Set environment variables in deployment environment
4. Ensure CORS is properly configured on the backend
5. Set up proper security rules for Firestore and other Firebase services

## Security Best Practices

1. Always verify ID tokens on the backend before granting access
2. Use short-lived tokens and implement token refresh
3. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
4. Use HTTPS for all API communications
5. Store sensitive tokens securely in Firestore
6. Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints

## Future Improvements

1. Add additional authentication methods (email/password, other OAuth providers)
2. Implement role-based access control
3. Add multi-factor authentication
4. Improve error handling and user feedback
5. Implement progressive enhancement for authentication flows
