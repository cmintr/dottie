- **Data**: Test fixtures and synthetic data
- **Access**: Automated systems

### Internal Testing Environment

- **Purpose**: Manual testing by internal team
- **Configuration**: Full integration with test Google Workspace accounts
- **Data**: Controlled test data
- **Access**: Development and QA teams

### Beta Testing Environment

- **Purpose**: Limited external user testing
- **Configuration**: Production-like with monitoring
- **Data**: Mix of test and real user data
- **Access**: Beta testers (invited users)

### Production Environment

- **Purpose**: Live application
- **Configuration**: Full production setup
- **Data**: Real user data

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Sources

1. **Mock Data**:
   - Predefined in code for unit and component tests
   - Configurable for different test scenarios

2. **Test Fixtures**:
   - JSON files for API responses
   - Seed data for test databases

3. **Synthetic Google Workspace Data**:
   - Test Google accounts with controlled data
   - Emails, calendar events, and documents created for testing

4. **Anonymized Production Data**:
   - Sanitized copies of production data for realistic testing
   - Personal information removed or obfuscated

### Data Management Practices

1. **Data Isolation**:
   - Each test environment has isolated data
   - Tests clean up after themselves

2. **Data Refresh**:
   - Regular refresh of test data
   - Reset to baseline state between test runs

3. **Sensitive Data Handling**:
   - No real user data in development or CI environments
   - Strict access controls for test environments with real data
